Objective: To determine the items on the plate.
Available items: pretzel rods, pretzel bites, green grapes, fruit gummies


You have been given an image of a plate. From the available items, what items are present, as a comma-separated list? Format your answer in one-line as follows: first_item, second_item, third_item. Do not list an item that is not in the given list of available items.
Assume that everything on the plate is listed in the available items. Do not return a food item which is not present in the "Available Items" list. If 3 different food items are on the plate then the list should contain 3 food items. Make sure the number of distinguishable items detected is the number of elements in the list.
Always return an item on the list, unless there is absolutely no object detected.
